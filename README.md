Usage Instructions
1. On the sign-in page, you'll see a drop-down menu for selecting what year you'll be registering contestants for. After selecting the year, the username is "admin" and the password is "pass"
2. On the menu page, you'll find links to the other two pages you'll be using to manage the database: Events and Participants. Additionally, the "log out" button will sign you out of the database.
3. On both the Participants page and the Events page, you'll find the navbar at the top of the screen. The navbar contains the same links as the menu page. The small image in the top left is also a link, but that one will lead you back to the menu page.
4. On the Participants page, you'll find a list of all contestants/contestant groups currently registered for the Jamboree. By clicking the "Add Participant" button, you'll be taken to a page where you can fill out the information for a new contestant/contestant group. Back on the participant list, there are three buttons associated with each participant: Edit, Delete, and Entry. The edit button allows you to change information on that participant. The delete button immediately deletes the participant from the database. The entry button allows you to view all information for that participant.
5. On the Events page, you'll find a list of all events present in the database. The "Add Event" button functions the same as the "Add Participant" button on the participant list. Back on the list itself, there are three buttons associated with each event: Edit, Delete, and Participants. Edit and Delete both work the same for events as they do for participants. The Participants button shows a list (in reverse order) of the contestants registered for the event.
